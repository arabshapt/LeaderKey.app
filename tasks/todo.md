# Leader Key Unresponsive State Fix

## Problem Analysis
Leader Key was becoming unresponsive when the window couldn't properly handle escape key events, showing warnings about `makeKeyWindow` failing.

## Root Cause
1. **Window Key State Conflict**: The window was trying to become key (to receive keyboard input) but this interferes with overlay apps like Raycast
2. **Failed makeKeyWindow Calls**: Logs showed repeated warnings that `makeKeyWindow` was being called but returning NO from `canBecomeKeyWindow`
3. **Event Tap Dependency**: Leader Key must rely entirely on its global event tap for keyboard events to avoid interfering with other overlays

## Implementation Summary (Revised)

### 1. ✅ Maintained Non-Key Window Status
- Kept `canBecomeKey` as `false` in MainWindow.swift to prevent interference with Raycast and similar overlay apps
- Window remains a non-activating panel that doesn't steal focus

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Escape Key Handling in Event Tap
- Escape key handling already checks multiple conditions in the global event tap:
  - Window visibility (`isVisible`)
  - Window opacity (`alphaValue > 0`)
  - Active sequence state (`currentSequenceGroup` or `activeRootGroup`)
- This ensures escape works without requiring the window to be key

### 3. ✅ Removed makeKeyAndOrderFront Calls
- Replaced all `makeKeyAndOrderFront` calls with `orderFront` to avoid trying to make window key
- Updated window activation logic in AppDelegate.swift to only check visibility
- Modified MainWindow.swift and Controller.swift to use `orderFront` exclusively

### 4. ✅ Simplified State Recovery
- Removed attempts to make window key in recovery mechanism
- State recovery now only checks for stuck sequences (visible window with no active group)
- Automatically hides window if detected in inconsistent state

### 5. ✅ Build and Testing
- Successfully built the project with all changes
- Window no longer attempts to become key, preventing Raycast interference
- Escape key handling works through global event tap

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **MainWindow.swift**: Kept `canBecomeKey` as `false` (reverted earlier change)
2. **AppDelegate.swift**: 
   - Removed all `makeKeyAndOrderFront` calls, replaced with `orderFront`
   - Simplified window activation to only check visibility
   - Removed key window checks from state recovery
3. **Controller.swift**: Changed `makeKeyAndOrderFront` to `orderFront`

### Key Improvements:
- Window never becomes key, avoiding conflicts with overlay apps
- Escape key handling works reliably through global event tap
- No more warning messages about failed `makeKeyWindow` calls
- Automatic recovery from stuck states without interfering with other apps

## Result
Leader Key remains responsive while preserving compatibility with Raycast and similar overlay applications. The escape key works through the global event tap without requiring the window to accept direct keyboard input.

## Event Tap Safeguards Added

### 1. ✅ Periodic Health Check (Every 1 Second)
- Checks if event tap is still enabled
- Automatically re-enables if disabled by system
- Restarts entire event tap if re-enable fails
- Critical for high CPU scenarios where macOS disables slow event taps

### 2. ✅ Automatic Event Tap Restart
- `restartEventTap()` method stops, cleans up, and restarts the tap
- Hides any stuck windows during restart
- Brief delay (0.1s) ensures proper cleanup before restart

### 3. ✅ Enhanced State Recovery
- Window state check every 5 seconds
- Detects stuck window (visible but no active sequence)
- Only checks `isVisible`, respects user's opacity settings (can be 0)
- Automatically hides stuck windows

### 4. ✅ Force Reset Works Independently
- Force Reset (Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+K) registered as global hotkey
- Works even if event tap completely fails
- Performs nuclear reset: hides window, clears state, restarts tap
- No need for separate fallback escape - force reset handles all failure scenarios

## Final Implementation
Leader Key now has robust safeguards against event tap failures, especially important for users with high CPU usage. The 1-second health check ensures quick recovery from system-disabled taps, while the force reset provides a guaranteed escape hatch that works independently of the event tap system.
