## Config Metadata Implementation Details

### API Documentation

```swift
struct ConfigMetadata: Codable {
    var customName: String?      // User-defined name for the config
    var createdAt: Date?         // When the config was first created
    var lastModified: Date?      // Last modification timestamp
    var author: String?          // Config author/creator
}

extension UserConfig {
    // Load metadata for a given config file
    func loadMetadata(for configPath: String) -> ConfigMetadata?
    
    // Save metadata for a config file
    func saveMetadata(_ metadata: ConfigMetadata, for configPath: String)
    
    // Delete metadata when config is removed
    func deleteMetadata(for configPath: String)
    
    // Private helper to generate metadata file path
    private func metadataPath(for configPath: String) -> String
}
```

### File Structure
```
~/Library/Application Support/Leader Key/
├── config.json                  # Main config file
├── config.meta.json             # Associated metadata
├── another-config.json          # Another config
└── another-config.meta.json    # Its metadata
```

### Features
- **Automatic Migration**: Existing custom names in Defaults are migrated to metadata files
- **Portable Metadata**: When configs are shared or copied, metadata travels with them
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new metadata fields in the future
- **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to Defaults storage if metadata files don't exist
- **Clean Separation**: Config structure remains unchanged; metadata is completely separate

### Usage Examples:
1. **Renaming a Config**: Updates both metadata file and Defaults (for compatibility)
2. **Saving a Config**: Automatically updates lastModified timestamp
3. **Loading Configs**: Checks metadata files first, then Defaults storage
4. **Deleting a Config**: Removes both config and metadata files

## Performance Improvements Summary

### Overview
Three iterative optimization passes were conducted to improve app performance, focusing on CPU usage, memory consumption, and responsiveness.

### Key Optimizations

## Deep Navigation Feature Documentation

### Overview
Context-aware navigation that opens relevant settings based on the active leader key sequence when pressing Cmd+,

### How It Works
1. **Context Tracking**: The app tracks your current leader key sequence
2. **Smart Navigation**: When you press Cmd+, while a sequence is active, it navigates to the relevant settings section
3. **Direct Access**: Jump directly to the configuration for the specific key binding you're using

### User Benefits
- **Faster Configuration**: No need to manually navigate through settings
- **Context Preservation**: Settings open relevant to what you were just doing
- **Improved Workflow**: Seamless transition from usage to configuration

### Implementation Details
- **AppDelegate**: 171 lines of navigation logic added
- **Controller**: New methods to track and expose active sequences
- **GeneralPane**: Enhanced to receive and handle deep navigation
- **UserState**: Tracks navigation context for proper routing

### Usage Example
1. Start typing a leader key sequence (e.g., `leader` + `g`)
2. Press Cmd+, while the overlay is visible
3. Settings open directly to the configuration for that key binding
4. Make your changes without searching through the entire config

### Technical Architecture
```
User Input → Controller (tracks sequence) → 
Cmd+, pressed → AppDelegate (determines context) → 
GeneralPane (navigates to specific section)
```

## Release Build Configuration Fix (2025-08-19)

### Problem Resolved
User reported that archived builds wouldn't run after being created in Xcode.

### Root Cause
- Project was configured with `"CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=macosx*]" = "-"` which disabled code signing
- Missing entitlements for accessibility features the app requires
- No proper Release build commands documented

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Code Signing Configuration
- Removed problematic `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` override from both Debug and Release configurations
- Updated Release configuration to use ad-hoc signing (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"` with `CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Manual`)
- Maintained automatic signing for Debug configuration

#### 2. Added Required Entitlements 
Updated `Leader_Key.entitlements` with:
- `com.apple.security.device.input-monitoring` - Required for intercepting keyboard events
- `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` - Required for automation features

#### 3. Updated Build Documentation
Added to `CLAUDE.md`:
- Release build command: `xcodebuild -scheme "Leader Key" -configuration Release build`
- Archive command: `xcodebuild -scheme "Leader Key" -configuration Release archive -archivePath "build/Leader Key.xcarchive"`
- Export command: `xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath "build/Leader Key.xcarchive" -exportPath "Updates" -exportOptionsPlist exportOptions.plist`

#### 4. Created Export Options
- Added `exportOptions.plist` with proper settings for macOS app export
- Configured for ad-hoc signing and automatic team selection

### Testing Results
- ✅ Release configuration builds successfully
- ✅ Archive creation works without errors  
- ✅ App export to Updates/ directory successful
- ✅ Exported app launches and runs correctly
- ✅ Compatible with existing `bin/release` script workflow

### Impact
- Users can now successfully create release builds that actually run
- Existing release process (`bin/release`) works with new build configuration
- App properly requests accessibility permissions when needed
- Builds are properly signed for local distribution

### Update: App Launch Issue Resolution (2025-08-19)

#### Additional Problem Discovered
After initial fix, exported app still failed to launch with error:
```
Library not loaded: @rpath/Sparkle.framework/Versions/B/Sparkle
Reason: mapping process and mapped file (non-platform) have different Team IDs
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Hardened Runtime + Ad-hoc Signing Conflict**: `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES` was enabled for Release builds
- **Framework Loading Restriction**: Hardened runtime with ad-hoc signing creates strict validation between main app and frameworks  
- **Team ID Mismatch**: macOS refused to load Sparkle.framework due to perceived signing inconsistencies

#### Solution Applied
**Disabled Hardened Runtime for Release Configuration**:
- Removed `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES;` from Release configuration only (line 729 in project.pbxproj)
- Kept hardened runtime enabled for Debug configuration to maintain development security
- Maintained ad-hoc signing approach for local distribution

#### Final Testing Results
- ✅ Release configuration builds successfully
- ✅ Archive creation works without errors
- ✅ App export to Updates/ directory successful  
- ✅ **App launches and runs correctly** (process confirmed running)
- ✅ No framework loading errors
- ✅ Compatible with existing release workflow

#### Technical Notes
- Hardened runtime provides additional security but requires consistent code signing across all app components
- For local/ad-hoc distribution, disabling hardened runtime eliminates framework loading restrictions
- Debug builds retain hardened runtime for development security
- App Store distribution would require proper developer certificate signing with hardened runtime

## CPU Wakes Fix - Performance Optimization Review

### Date: 2025-08-19
### Type: Critical Performance Fix
### Status: Completed

### Problem Statement
LeaderKey was generating 8,526 CPU wakes per second, causing excessive battery drain and system load. This was discovered through Xcode Instruments monitoring.

### Root Cause Analysis
The event processor thread was using a busy-wait loop with `usleep(100)` (0.1ms sleep) to check for queued events, causing the thread to wake up 10,000 times per second even when completely idle.

### Solution Implemented
Replaced the busy-wait loop with a semaphore-based event notification system:

#### Technical Changes:
1. **Added DispatchSemaphore** (`eventProcessorSemaphore`) to signal when events are available
2. **Modified event processor** to use `semaphore.wait(timeout:)` instead of `usleep()`  
3. **Added event signaling** in `triggerEventProcessing()` when events are queued
4. **Implemented batch processing** with self-signaling for multiple queued events

#### Files Modified:
- `Leader Key/AppDelegate.swift` (4 key modifications)

### Performance Impact
- **Before**: 8,526 wakes/second (excessive CPU activity)
- **After**: <100 wakes/second (10 from timeout + event-driven wakes)
- **Reduction**: 98.8% fewer CPU wakes
- **Benefits**: 
  - Significantly reduced battery consumption
  - Lower CPU usage during idle periods
  - Reduced system resource contention
  - Maintained sub-millisecond event response time

### Testing Verification
- Created `test_cpu_wakes.sh` script for verification
- Build successful with all changes
- Semaphore signaling confirmed in logs
- Event processing latency unchanged (<1ms)

### Code Quality
- Simple, minimal change (4 small edits)
- No complex refactoring required
- Backward compatible
- Thread-safe implementation
- Clear separation of concerns

### Business Impact
This fix directly addresses user concerns about battery life and system performance, making LeaderKey more suitable for all-day usage without impacting system resources.
