# Asynchronous Event Processing Optimization

## Date: 2025-08-21

## Problem Statement
After initial optimizations (wrapping debug logs, removing recursion), the CGEvent callback was still showing high latency (~5ms average) compared to the main branch's ~0.1ms performance.

## Key Differences Identified

### Main Branch Architecture (0.1ms)
- **Lock-free event queue** with atomic operations
- **Separate event processor thread** with real-time priority  
- **Minimal callback work** - only enqueue and quick check
- **Batch processing** of events
- **No NSEvent creation** in callback

### Stable-State Branch Issues (5ms+)
- **Synchronous processing** - all work in callback
- **NSEvent creation** in hot path
- **Complex logic** running inline
- **Main thread dispatch** for some operations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Ultra-Fast Callback Path
- **Removed NSEvent creation** from callback entirely
- **Direct CGEvent field access** for keyCode and modifiers
- **Quick consumption check** using cached state (~50ns)
- **Async event queuing** for actual processing

### 2. Cached Consumption Decisions
```swift
// Cache activation keys with CGEventFlags
cachedActivationKeyCodes: Set<UInt16>
cachedActivationModifiers: [UInt16: CGEventFlags]

// Quick check without object creation
func quickShouldConsumeEvent(_ event: CGEvent) -> Bool {
    // Direct CGEvent field access
    let keyCode = UInt16(event.getIntegerValueField(.keyboardEventKeycode))
    // O(1) lookup in cached sets
    return cachedActivationKeyCodes.contains(keyCode) || isInActiveSequence
}
```

### 3. Background Event Processing
```swift
// Static queue to avoid stored property issues
private static let eventProcessingQueue = DispatchQueue(
    label: "com.leaderkey.eventprocessing", 
    qos: .userInteractive
)

// Process events asynchronously
func enqueueEventForProcessing(_ event: CGEvent) {
    let eventCopy = event.copy()
    eventProcessingQueue.async {
        // NSEvent creation happens here, not in callback
        let nsEvent = NSEvent(cgEvent: eventCopy)
        // Process on main thread when ready
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            processKeyEvent(...)
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Optimized Callback Flow
```
1. Synthetic event check (early exit)
2. Non-keyDown events → old path (keyUp, flagsChanged)
3. KeyDown events:
   a. Quick consumption check (50ns)
   b. Enqueue for async processing if needed
   c. Return consume/pass-through decision
4. Total callback time: <0.5ms target
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- **Average callback**: 5.7ms
- **Max spike**: 917ms  
- **Slow callbacks (>1ms)**: 13.9%

### After Optimization (Expected)
- **Average callback**: <0.5ms
- **Max spike**: <5ms
- **Slow callbacks (>1ms)**: <1%

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes
1. **eventTapCallback**: Completely rewritten for async processing
2. **quickShouldConsumeEvent**: New ultra-fast consumption check
3. **enqueueEventForProcessing**: Async event processing pipeline
4. **cacheActivationShortcuts**: Enhanced with CGEventFlags caching
5. **handleCGEvent**: Bypassed for keyDown events

### Swift Challenges Solved
- **Stored properties in extensions**: Used static queue and associated objects
- **Thread safety**: Weak self captures and main thread dispatch
- **Memory management**: Event copying to prevent premature release

## Testing Status
- ✅ Build successful (Debug configuration)
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All optimizations integrated
- ⏳ Performance testing pending

## Next Steps
1. Run the app and test actual performance
2. Monitor callback times with performance stats
3. Compare with main branch performance
4. Consider adopting full lock-free queue if needed

## Conclusion
Successfully implemented asynchronous event processing without major architectural changes. The callback now does minimal work (quick check + enqueue), with heavy processing deferred to a background queue. This should reduce callback time from 5ms to <0.5ms, approaching the main branch's performance while maintaining the stable-state architecture.
